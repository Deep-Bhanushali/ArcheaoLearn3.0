    mythVersion: "Plato described Atlantis as a powerful naval empire that existed 9,000 years before his time. The island was said to be larger than Libya and Asia combined, with concentric rings of water and land, golden statues, and advanced technology. The Atlanteans became corrupt and greedy, leading the gods to punish them with earthquakes and floods.",
    factVersion: "Modern archaeology has found no concrete evidence of Atlantis. Many scholars believe Plato invented it as a philosophical allegory about the hubris of nations. Some theories link it to real ancient civilizations like the Minoans of Crete or the city of Helike, which was destroyed by an earthquake. Underwater explorations have found ancient cities, but none matching Plato's specific description.",

The construction took only five days.",
